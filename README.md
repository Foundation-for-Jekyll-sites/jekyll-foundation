Quickstart your Jekyll (v3) project with Zurb Foundation for Sites (v6, sass).

This package is meant to build your Site on your local machine.

It provides a [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) workflow with

- Browsersync (live reload and synchronised browser testing)
- Concatenation and minification of CSS and JavaScript files
- Asset management is done by Bower (and Composer if you need serverside libraries)  
- Deployment with rsync
